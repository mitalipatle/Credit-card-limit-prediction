Credit limit is the maximium amount of money or credit that a financial institution can lend to its credit card client/customer at one time.There are multiple important factors which helps these institutions decide credit limit for a client such as Income, payment history and debts, thus they give higher credit limit to lower risk borrower and vice versa. As the credit limit subject to change based on client's behaviour and spending, this process could be challenging and time consuming and thus a system is required which could predict credit limit for the client based on the various different features.
