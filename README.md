# Credit-card-limit-prediction

## Introduction:
Credit card plays an important part of everyone's life as it is not only the safer option than carrying cash but also protects an individual from fraud or scams, where
the maximum amount of money or credit that a financial institution can lend to a credit card customer or client at once is known as the credit limit. These banks consider a number of crucial aspects when determining a client's credit limit, including income, payment history, and debts. As a result, they grant larger credit limits to lower-risk borrowers and vice versa. It is necessary to develop a system that can predict the client's credit limit based on a variety of features because the credit limit is susceptible to vary depending on the client's behavior and expenditure which could make this process challenging and time consuming.

## Scope:
The project aims to solve the regression problem by applying machine learning models to predict credit card limit.
Below is the breif overview of the project workflow:
##### 1). Loading the essential libraries and importing and reading the dataset.
##### 2). Cleaning the dataset to remove irrelevant and missing information using data cleaning and manipulation techniques.
##### 3). Visualizing the dataset using graphs, charts and figures to gain better understaning of the data.
##### 4). Detecting and removing oultiers using outliers removal technique.
##### 5). Feature selection using backward elimination approach and performing transformation on response variable(credit limit).
##### 6). Applying multiple machine learning algorithms to train the models and evaluate their performance using different metrics and visualisation.

## Data Description:
