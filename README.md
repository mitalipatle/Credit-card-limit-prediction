# Credit-card-limit-prediction

## Introduction:
The maximum amount of money or credit that a financial institution can lend to a credit card customer or client at once is known as the credit limit. These banks consider a number of crucial aspects when determining a client's credit limit, including income, payment history, and debts. As a result, they grant larger credit limits to lower-risk borrowers and vice versa. It is necessary to develop a system that can predict the client's credit limit based on a variety of features because the credit limit is susceptible to vary depending on the client's behavior and expenditure which could make this process challenging and time consuming.
