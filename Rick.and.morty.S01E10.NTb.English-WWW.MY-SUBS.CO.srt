00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:06,205
- So, dad, guess what tomorrow is.
- Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday.

2
00:00:06,207 --> 00:00:07,306
No.

3
00:00:07,308 --> 00:00:09,042
- Well, it... might be.
- It is.

4
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:13,912
Fine. But also, tomorrow is your
one-year anniversary back in our lives.

5
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:16,114
I'm gonna make you
flying-saucer-shaped pancakes.

6
00:00:16,116 --> 00:00:17,830
Oh, t-t-there's no
need to do that, Beth.

7
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:19,477
Regular pancakes are fine.

8
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,524
Oh, my God!

9
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,826
Oh, what is happening?!

00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,897
- Happy anniversary, dad.
- Oh, I get it.

12
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,398
Regular pancakes are already
shaped like flying saucers.

13
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,597
I-I should be making <i>you</i> breakfast
for putting up with <i>me</i>.

14
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:12,214
<i>You</i> should be making
us a whole restaurant.

15
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,040
Nonsense. We couldn't be
happier to have you around.

16
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,975
I just wish I got
to see more of you.

17
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:21,447
Rick Sanchez of earth
dimension C-137,

18
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,981
you are under arrest
for crimes against

19
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:24,445
alternate Ricks by the authority

20
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,152
of the trans-dimensional
council of Ricks.

21
00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:29,186
- Hey! What the heck?!
- Neutralize the Jerry.

22
00:01:29,188 --> 00:01:30,122
Wait! No! I'll --

23
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:30,856
Dad!

24
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:32,357
- Dad!
- Rick!

25
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,492
Everybody, relax.

26
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,828
If I know these a-holes,
and I am these a-holes,

27
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,262
they just want to haul
me to their stupid

28
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,498
clubhouse and waste my time with
a bunch of questions.

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,499
Let's get it over with.

30
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,467
Bring his Morty.

31
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,936
- Oh, man.
- Leave my Morty out of this.

32
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:46,371
You lost the right to have a
say in these things when you

33
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:47,940
refused to j-- join the
council.

34
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,341
W-w-w-what about Jerry?

35
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:52,278
Will you at least
unfreeze my daughter's idiot?

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
...Give you anything!

37
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,482
I have a rare antique-coin
collection!

38
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,950
Just don't hurt me!

39
00:01:59,952 --> 00:02:03,089
Okay, maybe not antique,
but it was a limited minting.

40
00:02:03,091 --> 00:02:05,090
They have little R2-D2s instead
of George Washington.

41
00:02:05,092 --> 00:02:08,560
- Our son's been abducted!
- You hate me for buying those coins!

42
00:02:11,362 --> 00:02:14,867
- Geez, Rick, w-what is this place?
- The citadel of Ricks.

43
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,936
It's the secret headquarters for
the council of Ricks.

44
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,304
Council of Ricks?

45
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:21,206
As you know, Morty, I've
got a lot of enemies

46
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:23,376
in the universe that consider
my genius a threat --

47
00:02:23,378 --> 00:02:26,177
galactic terrorists,
a few sub-galactic dictators,

48
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:28,012
most of the entire intergalactic
government.

49
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,882
Wherever you find people
with heads up their asses,

50
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,350
someone wants a piece
of your grandpa,

51
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:34,052
and a lot of versions
of me on different timelines had

52
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,889
the same problem, so a few
thousand versions of me had the

53
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:39,758
ingenious idea of
banding together

54
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,860
like a herd of cattle or a
school of fish or those

55
00:02:41,862 --> 00:02:44,295
people who answer questions on
yahoo! Answers.

56
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,631
Hey! What do you know?
It's a cowboy version of me.

57
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,100
Geez, you're easy to impress.

58
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:50,836
Yeah, most timelines have a Rick,
and most Ricks have a Morty.

59
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,372
This place is a real who's who
of who's you and me.

60
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:57,576
Turn your boring, old Morty
into a-- hot fashion statement

61
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,077
with some Morty dazzlers.

62
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,679
Hey, check this out.

63
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:01,680
<i>Show me the Morty.</i>

64
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,447
Dumb.

65
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,416
Excuse me, sir,
is your Morty insured?

66
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,785
You know, every year,
hundreds of Mortys are injured --

67
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,719
Back off!

68
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,087
Not my cup of tea, this place.

69
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:11,590
I say the point of being a Rick
is being a Rick.

70
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:15,505
Save your anti-Rick speech for the
council of Ricks, terror-Rick.

71
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,764
Hey, save your Rick rules for the
sheep-Ricks, Rick-pig.

72
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:20,732
- [beep] me, pal.
- [beep] <i>you</i>?

73
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:23,135
No, no, no, no, no.
[beep] <i>me</i>.

74
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:37,111
Bring up the holograms.

75
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:42,254
27 Ricks brutally murdered in
their own timelines--

76
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:45,457
an unprecedented Rick-icidal
epidemic.

77
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,426
What say you, earth Rick C-137?

78
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:49,728
You think I did this?

79
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,631
Why am I the first Rick you pull in
every time a Rick stubs his toe?

80
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:56,397
You have a history of
non-cooperation with the council.

81
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah, so does the scientist
formerly known as Rick.

82
00:03:58,806 --> 00:04:00,806
W-w-w-w-w-why isn't
<i>he</i> here in handcuffs?

83
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,375
Because <i>he's</i> dead, too!

84
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,811
Who else would you
have us question?

85
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:06,979
You fit the profile.

86
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,615
Of all the Ricks in the central
finite curve,

87
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,317
you're the malcontent,
the rogue.

88
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,218
I'm the Rick,

89
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,554
and so were the rest of you before
you formed this stupid alliance.

90
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,056
You wanted to be safe
from the government,

91
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,758
so you became a
stupid government.

92
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,793
That makes every Rick here less
Rick than me.

93
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,796
Yeah, murmur it up, d-bags.

94
00:04:24,798 --> 00:04:25,964
Now, if you'll excuse me,

95
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,000
I've got pancakes back home with
syrup on top of them.

96
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,002
They're about to hit that
critical point of syrup

97
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,671
absorption that turns the cakes
into a gross paste,

98
00:04:32,673 --> 00:04:33,872
and I hate to get all
Andy Rooney about it,

99
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:37,175
but I think we all like Fluffy
disks of cake with syrup on top,

100
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:41,179
and I think we also like to be accused
of crimes when there's evidence!

101
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,949
So, as they say in Canada,
peace oot!

102
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,151
Evidence! Good idea.

103
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:47,919
Scan his portal gun!

104
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,187
Oh, come on.

105
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,456
Don't look at another man's
portal-gun history.

106
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,692
We -- we all go to weird places.

107
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,195
Yes, but it appears you alone
have been going to the exact

108
00:04:57,197 --> 00:05:00,899
timelines and locations in which
the murders occurred.

109
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:03,035
What?!
That's Rick-diculous!

110
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,569
I'm obviously being set up.

111
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,039
Earth Rick C-137, the council

112
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:11,043
of Ricks sentences you to the
machine of unspeakable doom,

113
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:14,012
which swaps your conscious and
unconscious minds,

114
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:15,647
rendering your fantasies
pointless while

115
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,884
everything you've known becomes
impossible to grasp.

116
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:21,520
Also, every 10 seconds,
it stabs your balls.

117
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,389
I've heard enough.

118
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,459
Run, Morty!

119
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,760
Unh-unh. Not you.

120
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,664
Aaaah!

121
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:35,489
No!

122
00:05:54,619 --> 00:05:55,921
Oh! Oh!

123
00:05:59,023 --> 00:06:02,660
Yeah, I'd like to order one large
person with extra people, please.

124
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:04,529
White people.
No, no, no, no. Black people.

125
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,131
And hispanic on half.

126
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:21,346
Yes, I'd like to order one large
sofa chair with extra chair, please.

127
00:06:21,448 --> 00:06:23,315
High chair.
No, no, no, no. Recliner.

128
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,283
And wheelchair on half.

129
00:06:36,857 --> 00:06:39,431
They could have gone into any
one of these.

130
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,299
- Son of a...
- Oh, geez.

131
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,968
- Oh, man!
- We lost 'em.

132
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,104
Yeah, I'd like to order one large
phone with extra phones, please.

133
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,773
Cellphone.
No, no, no, no. Rotary.

134
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:49,675
And pay phone on half.

135
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,778
That'll keep 'em busy for a while.

136
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,016
Those guys were wrong, right?

137
00:06:58,018 --> 00:06:59,917
Y-y-y-you-- you wouldn't kill
yourself -- yourselves.

138
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,187
Of course not, Morty.
How could that profit me?

139
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:03,855
But someone out there
<i>is</i> killing Ricks,

140
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,690
and the council ain't
gonna stop thinking it's me

141
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:08,559
until we clear our names --
by finding the real Rick-killer.

142
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:09,728
I'm scared, Rick.

143
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,296
Maybe we should go home and
stockpile weapons,

144
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,898
like that show
"doomsday preppers".

145
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:14,332
Not really my style, Morty.

146
00:07:14,334 --> 00:07:17,264
Besides, your home is most likely
swarming with Ricks by now.

147
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,463
All right, listen, Jerry.
If Rick calls,

148
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:24,208
this device is gonna
trace his location.

149
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:27,112
You just got to keep him on the
phone for 30 seconds or longer.

150
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:28,146
Who wants lemonade?

151
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,614
Oh, yeah.

152
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:32,517
Mmm!
Oh! Delicious!

153
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:34,019
Beth you're a treasure.

154
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:37,355
I have a Beth just like you in my
reality, except you know what?

155
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,225
She's not as brilliant or
attractive.

156
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:43,328
Aw.
Thank you.

157
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,263
Oh! She did! She did it!

158
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,379
H-hello?

159
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:54,339
- <i>Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.</i>
- Rick! Hey.

160
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,207
What's -- what's up?

161
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,242
<i>So, listen, the heat's on,
and there's nowhere left to turn,</i>

162
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:01,475
<i>so Morty and I are just gonna fly
my spaceship into a black hole.</i>

163
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,681
- What?!
<i>- Is that cool with you, dawg?</i>

164
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:03,515
Rick, no!

165
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,050
- Morty!!
- We got it.

166
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:06,384
The call's coming from...

167
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:08,386
♪ inside the house ♪

168
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,055
Look at his face!
You dummy!

169
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,224
Can't believe our daughter
married you.

170
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,258
Too easy!

171
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:17,028
The Ricks are probably gonna waste
some time messing with Jerry.

172
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,230
They won't be able to help
themselves.

173
00:08:18,232 --> 00:08:20,098
But as soon as they get bored,
they'll be onto us.

174
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,501
Phones à la clams and
phonesghetti with phone balls.

175
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,103
- Anything else?
- Yeah, more phone sticks, please.

176
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:26,037
Right away, sir.

177
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,740
You know, Rick, when I
first saw all those Ricks and Mortys,

178
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:31,076
I thought, "Gee, that
kind of devalues our bond".

179
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,945
But then I realized it just
means that our relationship must

180
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,814
be pretty special to span over
all those different timelines.

181
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,049
Yeah, it's <i>got</i> to be that way.

182
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,685
- You're a camouflage.
- Camouflage?

183
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,187
What are you talking
about, Rick?

184
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:45,357
Ricks have a very distinctive and
traceable brain wave due to our genius.

185
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,926
The best way to hide from an
enemy's radar is to stand near

186
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:50,725
someone with complementary brain
waves that make ours invisible.

187
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,297
See, when a Rick
is with a Morty,

188
00:08:53,299 --> 00:08:56,869
the genius waves get
canceled out by the, uh...

189
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,039
...Morty waves.

190
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,508
Um... Because o-our personalities
are so different?

191
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,276
Oh, shit, dawg.

192
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:06,345
My portal gun was hacked
remotely, Morty--

193
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,379
obviously by the real
killer, to frame me.

194
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,914
But I was able to trace the
signal.

195
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,249
Come on. Let's go.

196
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:12,285
- Uh-oh.
- Excuse me.

197
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,320
We've tracked a pair of dangerous
criminals to this exact location.

198
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:18,089
They look exactly like us,
so in order to avoid confusion,

199
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,091
I'm gonna mark us each
with a red "X" right now.

200
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,794
That way, if someone has a gun
and we both tell you to shoot

201
00:09:22,796 --> 00:09:25,797
the other one because <i>they're</i> the
evil one, you'll know who's lying.

202
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,800
Hey, check it out.

203
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:30,068
Damn it!

204
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,941
- Hey, you didn't pay your bill!
- The red "X"! Red "X"!

205
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,609
Hey, it's a good thing
that space outlet had lab coats

206
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:40,511
and your favorite kind of shirt
in stock, huh, Morty?

207
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,147
Yeah, Rick, I-I heard
you the first time.

208
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,815
You don't have to keep saying it
over and over.

209
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,784
Man, this place is way
off the grid.

210
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,152
This guy does not
want to be found.

211
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:48,320
Well, if he's a Rick,

212
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,288
doesn't he just have to stand by
a Morty to hide?

213
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,490
I mean, isn't that what Mortys
are -- human cloaking devices?

214
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,927
Morty, you're making a bigger
deal out of this than it is.

215
00:09:56,997 --> 00:09:58,930
Oh, my God, Rick, look!

216
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,366
There's a bunch of people
strapped all over that building!

217
00:10:01,368 --> 00:10:04,869
Not people, Morty -- Mortys.

218
00:10:11,107 --> 00:10:12,379
Oh, God!

219
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:15,347
W-w-why would somebody do this?
It's horrible!

220
00:10:15,349 --> 00:10:17,048
Well, one Morty's enough to
hide from the bureaucrats,

221
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:19,050
but you get -- you
get a whole matrix of Mortys and

222
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,218
put them in agonizing pain,

223
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,488
that creates a pattern that can hide
even from other Ricks [beep].

224
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,858
I fiddled with a concept
like this once.

225
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,960
On paper, Morty. On paper.

226
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,162
I wouldn't do this.
It's barbaric overkill.

227
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:33,397
I mean, you could accomplish
the same result with, like,

228
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:35,233
five Mortys and a jumper cable.

229
00:10:36,635 --> 00:10:38,778
Which I also wouldn't do!

230
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,206
I'm just saying,
it's bad craftsmanship.

231
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,874
- Coffee time!
- Yeah!

232
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:43,541
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

233
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:45,778
That's what I like to hear!

234
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:49,147
- Hi, Jerry.
- Leave me alone.

235
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,081
I'm working.

236
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,049
Oh, you are?

237
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,051
W-w-w-what do you do?

238
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:55,220
I-I'm -- I'm in between
advertising jobs.

239
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,188
Advertising? Wow!

240
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,423
So, people need help figuring

241
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,525
out what to buy, and then
y-y-you help 'em?

242
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:03,424
Well, it's a little more
complicated than that.

243
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,829
Well, I mean, you do it,

244
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,265
and you seem like a guy who
really has it all together.

245
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:14,072
Dude, are you -- w--
you're being a dick, right?

246
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,875
Oh, gosh, I-I hope not. I wouldn't
want to offend you in any way.

247
00:11:16,877 --> 00:11:19,411
You're really a Rick?

248
00:11:19,413 --> 00:11:22,881
Y-- of course I am -- just as
much as my Morty's a Morty.

249
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,580
Hey, he looks a lot like Eric
Stoltz from the movie "mask."

250
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,386
You know, the one
with Cher in it?

251
00:11:28,388 --> 00:11:29,421
That's right, Jerry!

252
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:31,089
He -- he's from a reality where

253
00:11:31,091 --> 00:11:33,191
everyone is Eric Stoltz "mask"
people.

254
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,559
He's Eric Stoltz mask Morty.

255
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,227
They assigned him to me because

256
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:37,896
I never had any kids of my own.

257
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,397
But if I did, boy, I'd love them

258
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,932
if they were as smart and as

259
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,367
successful as <i>you</i> are, Jerry.

260
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,902
Hey, get a load of this.

261
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,937
Jerry's hanging out with
doofus Rick.

262
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,372
This is perfect.

263
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,940
I'm not doofus Rick!

264
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,241
I'm Rick j19-zeta-7!

265
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:52,977
Oh, is that the timeline
where everybody eats poop?

266
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:55,146
Jerry, you know this guy eats
poop, right?

267
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,414
Hey, I don't eat poop!

268
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,850
Y-you guys are always
so mean to me.

269
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,421
I guess it's only fair to tell
you now, Jerry.

270
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,989
I'm the worst Rick of them all.

271
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,392
According to who --
other versions of you?

272
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,993
If I've learned one thing,

273
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:10,928
it's that before you
get anywhere in life,

274
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,597
you got to stop listening
to yourself.

275
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,432
Wow.
You really are wise, Jerry.

276
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,634
I-I-I guess that's why you work
in advertising.

277
00:12:16,636 --> 00:12:20,472
The fact that you feel that way makes
you the <i>best</i> Rick of them all.

278
00:12:20,474 --> 00:12:22,640
You don't care about me at all!

279
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:25,143
I'm no different than that
jacket you've got on!

280
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,345
Y-y-y-- o-or your stupid portal
gun!

281
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:28,246
I'm just a tool!

282
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,314
I-I-I'm just an object!

283
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:32,016
Hey, it's your choice
to take it personally, Morty.

284
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,618
Now, for the love of God,
be quiet.

285
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,286
The point of this is to get the
drop on the guy.

286
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:37,088
You know what, Rick?
I'll tell you something!

287
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,289
I'm more than a human shield!

288
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,457
Yeah, that's right.

289
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:40,024
You <i>are</i>.

290
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:42,460
You're a perfect, impenetrable
suit of human armor, Morty,

291
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:43,662
because you're as dumb as I am

292
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:45,430
smart, which is why when I say

293
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,432
"shut up," it's really
good advice.

294
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,903
Great. Nice work, Morty.

295
00:13:04,505 --> 00:13:07,152
Ooh. Look at you, C-137.

296
00:13:07,154 --> 00:13:09,020
You -- aren't you a tough
customer.

297
00:13:09,022 --> 00:13:10,288
The slow clap? Really?

298
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:11,389
Kind of played out, dude.

299
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,191
Not in this dimension, it isn't.

300
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:14,959
In fact I invented it.

301
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:17,061
Nobody else has ever even done
it here before.

302
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,196
Well, la-di-da.

303
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,531
Hey, that's mine!

304
00:13:23,533 --> 00:13:27,038
I don't like the look
of that Rick, Morty.

305
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,673
- We got to escape.
- I'm not gonna help you, Rick.

306
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,875
- Y-you're a monster.
- Don't be Rick-diculous, Morty.

307
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,044
Will you -- will you
stop saying that?

308
00:13:33,046 --> 00:13:33,912
It's stupid.

309
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,313
Take his Morty away.

310
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,247
Come with me.

311
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,682
Yeah, gladly.

312
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:40,018
Geez, man. Ricks, huh?

313
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,053
Hey, man, you seem to know how
this place works.

314
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,255
Is there any way we could shut

315
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,890
down that grid and rescue all
those Mortys outside?

316
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,091
It would be pointless.

317
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,261
Mortys have no chance of
defeating a Rick.

318
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:51,396
In here.

319
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:02,707
- Ah. Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah, yeah.

320
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,109
Looks like payday at
Neverland ranch in here.

321
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:05,710
Zing!

322
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,414
<i>- That</i> guy got it.
- Unh-unh-unh, Rick. Quiet.

323
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,382
You're missing my symphony.

324
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,287
Hey, I'll take it
over Mumford & Sons.

325
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:17,055
Zip!

326
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,857
This guy is on it!

327
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,925
He's not laughing at your
dumb jokes, Rick.

328
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,295
That's just a random noise it
makes every 10 seconds.

329
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,133
You see, Rick, you're not as
clever as you think you are.

330
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,435
I <i>wanted</i> you to find me.

331
00:14:30,705 --> 00:14:32,937
We're not so different, you and I.

332
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,072
Yeah, duh!

333
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,773
See this right here, Rick?

334
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,975
I crunched the numbers.

335
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:39,143
I created a spectrum
of all the Ricks.

336
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:41,946
I listed them out from most evil
to least evil.

337
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:42,981
Here's where I am.

338
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:45,750
And look it -- right here's where
you are, Rick.

339
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,385
This guy right here --
super-weird.

340
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,219
I get it.

341
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,387
So you want me to team up with

342
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,289
you to take down the council of
Ricks, right?

343
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,957
Is that where you're
going with this?

344
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,292
'Cause that's where
<i>I'd</i> be going.

345
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:54,926
Please.

346
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,095
I think I'm doing pretty good on
my own.

347
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,463
I'm simply gonna download the

348
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:02,333
contents of your brain and then
kill you.

349
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,269
Okay, if we add a little more

350
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:07,805
titanium nitrate and just a tad
of chlorified tartrate...

351
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,276
...Ovenless brownies!

352
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,077
Mmm. Mmm!

353
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,312
It's incredible what a gifted

354
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,481
mind can accomplish when
priorities are in order.

355
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:17,348
Well, come on.

356
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,150
I can't take <i>all</i> the credit,
Jerry.

357
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:21,986
- It was <i>your</i> idea.
- Come here, Jerry!

358
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,759
Hey, uh, come here.

359
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:30,194
I-I want to show you something.

360
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,896
Okay, look, everybody makes
fun of me for getting these,

361
00:15:32,898 --> 00:15:34,299
but you're a genius scientist.

362
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,499
What do <i>you</i> think? See?

363
00:15:35,502 --> 00:15:39,203
There's little R2-D2s where the
George Washingtons should be.

364
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:42,140
You know, Jerry, I'm not
gonna tell you that these will

365
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,809
increase in value or even hold
their <i>current</i> value.

366
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,312
The truth is, you bought them
because you like them.

367
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:48,479
They have value to <i>you</i>.

368
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:50,348
That's what matters.

369
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,421
- How long are you staying?
- Until we find your Rick.

370
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:00,423
I found mine.

371
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:05,097
- Help!
- There is no escape, my son.

372
00:16:05,099 --> 00:16:07,931
We will find our peace in the
next world.

373
00:16:07,933 --> 00:16:10,001
So, what -- you're
just gonna give up?

374
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:13,471
We're giving in -- to the
power of the one true Morty.

375
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,139
One day, he will return.

376
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:18,610
Praise the one true Morty.

377
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,912
Ugh.

378
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,847
All right, Mortys, listen up.

379
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:26,551
My name is Morty Smith, from
earth dimension C-137.

380
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:29,087
I know you're scared, because
<i>I'm</i> scared.

381
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:31,389
But that's no reason to accept
our fate!

382
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:32,256
We're Mortys!

383
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:35,026
We're not defined by our
relationships to Rick!

384
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:37,328
Our destiny is our own!

385
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,031
This sounds like something
the one true Morty might say.

386
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,532
I'm sick of being a human
shield.

387
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:43,568
I want to be a gardener!

388
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:47,071
I want to write really crazy,
intense action novels!

389
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,207
I'm more than just a hammer!

390
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,175
He is the one true Morty!

391
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,076
Hooray!

392
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:53,544
The one true Morty!

393
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,413
Hey, keep it down!

394
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:07,559
You've lived quite a life, Rick.

395
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,762
It's a real shame you're not gonna
be around to see it through.

396
00:17:18,764 --> 00:17:23,107
- You're crying? Over a Morty?
- No, I'm just allergic to dipshits.

397
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:24,108
Ugh. Pathetic.

398
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,876
We both know that if there's
any truth in the universe,

399
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,648
it's that Ricks don't
care about Mortys.

400
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,219
Do your worst, you little
bastards!

401
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,454
Kill me! Do it!

402
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,156
Do I-I-I-I-it!

403
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,091
Morty! Thank God!

404
00:17:40,093 --> 00:17:41,459
Get me out of this.

405
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,060
Come on!

406
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,928
You're lucky I'm not a Rick.

407
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,331
Point taken, but this
is no time for arcs.

408
00:17:48,635 --> 00:17:50,435
Oh!

409
00:17:56,007 --> 00:17:56,507
Yeah, hello.

410
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,910
Hey, what do me and
O.J. not have in common?

411
00:17:58,912 --> 00:17:59,977
Huh? W-who is this?

412
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,313
I found the real killer, bitch!

413
00:18:02,315 --> 00:18:03,881
Get over here!

414
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,220
Yo, ding-dong, we're done here.
Time to go.

415
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:13,091
Well, Jerry, I guess
this means goodbye.

416
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,992
W-w-well, does it have to?

417
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,095
I mean, you -- you look just
like Rick.

418
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,297
We could maybe, you know, get
rid of him.

419
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,332
I'm not saying kill him,
necessarily.

420
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:22,600
I -- I'm also not saying

421
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,535
necessarily <i>not</i> kill him, but --

422
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:27,271
Jerry, w-we both know it
wouldn't work.

423
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:30,341
It's time to go back to our
lives.

424
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,477
I love you, Jerry.
I love you.

425
00:18:48,355 --> 00:18:51,096
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!

426
00:18:54,998 --> 00:18:57,836
W-what -- w-what's gonna
happen to all these Mortys?

427
00:18:57,838 --> 00:19:00,404
They'll go back to their
families, attend school

428
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:04,041
regularly, play video games,
date girls.

429
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:07,211
Poor little rickless bastards.

430
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:09,547
Earth Rick C-137, the council

431
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:11,149
apologizes for its false

432
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:12,717
accusation, and in the way of

433
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,552
reparations for our

434
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,420
terrible mistake, we would like

435
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,156
to compensate you with this

436
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:19,991
voucher for a free replacement

437
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:21,359
Morty in the event that

438
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,060
your current Morty should --

439
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:25,396
Uh, guys, not a good time.

440
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:27,098
Come on, Morty. Let's hit it.

441
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,603
Is it time for arcs yet, Rick?

442
00:19:31,605 --> 00:19:34,705
I did a pretty good job back there
for a human cloaking device.

443
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,439
Saved your ass.

444
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:36,507
All right, Morty.

445
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,242
Don't break an arm jerking
yourself off.

446
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,077
Man, I can't believe you, Rick.

447
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:41,245
That right there, that w-- that

448
00:19:41,247 --> 00:19:44,081
was a great opportunity to show
a little humanity, you know?

449
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,650
- To connect with me a little.
- Hey, Morty, you want connection,

450
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,219
go be part of some stupid club,
like all those dumb Ricks.

451
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,722
You know, maybe I don't connect
because I'm the rickest Rick there is.

452
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:53,090
And, you know, it would

453
00:19:53,092 --> 00:19:54,592
g-- Go without saying

454
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,261
that the rickest Rick would have
the Mortyest Morty.

455
00:19:57,263 --> 00:20:00,598
- It would go without saying, huh?
- Yeah, it would.

456
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,401
- Did you hear me say it?
- Nah.

457
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,402
The Mortyest Morty.

458
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,371
Just don't get too big
for your loafers, Buster brown.

459
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,540
A cocky Morty can lead to some
big problems.

460
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,576
It can be a real bad thing for
everybody.

461
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:13,244
Oh, yeah? How's that?

462
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,247
U-uh, I'll explain when
you're older.

463
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,451
- What a mess.
- Pride cometh before the fall.

464
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22,386
I guess he got what he deserved.

465
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,287
What is <i>that</i>?

466
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:26,123
Hand me the laser difibulator.

467
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,792
Hey, guys, uh, c-can I help?

468
00:20:27,794 --> 00:20:29,160
No! Go clean the toilets.

469
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:31,095
Maybe you'll make friends with
some turds.

470
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,397
You make us ashamed to be
ourselves!

471
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:39,080
My God.
I've seen this technology before.

472
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:41,305
This Rick was being
controlled remotely --

473
00:20:41,307 --> 00:20:42,673
puppeteered by somebody else.

474
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:43,774
This is the receiver.

475
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:46,744
Yeah, but where's the
transmitter?

476
00:21:35,715 --> 00:21:38,763
- Wubba dubba dub dub!
- Oh. Hey, Jerry.

477
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,732
What are you doing
in my room, buddy?

478
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:44,368
Nothing. I was just, um,
checking the smoke detectors.

479
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,536
All right.

480
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,071
Okay, get out.

481
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:12,129
What's that dipshit doing out there?
Are you friends with him?

482
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,731
You know he eats his own shit,
right?

483
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,666
Oh, my God, this is rich!

484
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,569
I've got like 10 Ricks
to call right now.
